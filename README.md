Hand Movement Detection and Ball Control System

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="400" src="https://developers.google.com/static/mediapipe/images/solutions/hand-landmarks.png">
Overview
This project is an assignment that challenges students to develop a system using a camera to detect and track hand movements.
It utilizes the Mediapipe library for hand detection and tracking, and it aims to achieve the following objectives:

Extract the coordinates of a pointed finger.
Transmit this data to a C# program.
Create a graphical representation of a ball within a Windows Form application.
Utilize the transmitted coordinates to control the ball's movement.


Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python with Mediapipe library
Visual Studio or any C# development environment
Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your project up and running:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Mahmoud3mma/Hands-Detection-and-Ball-Movement.git
cd hand-movement-detection
Set up the Python environment:

Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install mediapipe
Run the Python hand detection script:

bash
Copy code
python hand_detection.py
Set up the C# environment:

Open the BallControlApp.sln solution file in Visual Studio.

Build and run the Windows Form application.

Point your finger towards the camera, and the ball's movement should be controlled by your hand movements.

Usage
Ensure you have a working camera connected to your system.
Launch the Python hand detection script to extract hand coordinates.
The coordinates are transmitted to the C# application to control the ball's movement.
